				<h2 class="primary-content__heading">Hi, it’s me again, and here is a bit about myself.</h2>
				<p>If you know me you already know that I love to learn and study. If you don't, my name is Malvina Hasa and this is my personal resume website. I am lucky enough to be living in New York, however I was born and raised in Albania. I have graduated from two business and economic universities thus far, one in Albania, and the other one in New York. Right after graduating I immediately took a 200-hour yoga training course (because I need to learn something… constantly). I was randomly selected to come to the United States and from that moment my life plans changed, although my goals stayed the same. That event gave me both the excitement of having the opportunities to make my dreams as a little girl from a small country come true, and the ability to dream bigger.  I have enjoyed a few passions so far such as painting, yoga, work in the hospitality industry, and more. I have recently discovered an interest in creating websites and making them compatible across devices, and that is my new excitement. My main focus is in learning and further developing front end techniques and skills such as HTML, CSS, SASS, JAVASCRIPT, responsive design, Git, debugging and other.</p>
