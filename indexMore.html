                    <h3>My System</h3>
                    <p>I love cultivating relationships with people who shock me with their greatness. I try to do my best to surround myself with dreamers, doers, believers, and thinkers because I want my world to continue to expand. I want to do more, learn more, see more...</p>
                    <p>I commit to controlling my procrastination levels by demanding discipline of myself.</p>

                <ul class="interests">
                    <li>I enjoy traveling, minimalism, and eating healthy.</li>
                    <li>Favorite word – productivity.</li>
                    <li>My number one mantra is: Keep your dreams close to your heart and watch what happens.</li>

                <div class="development">
                    <p>Web development is not only just a new passion for me. My goal is to develop a career in software engineering so that I can combine it in the future with my passion for designing, my love for math and science, my dedication on studying business and business for health professions, and the desire to bring about change in the world. In doing so I would be one step closer to creating and defining a product that can positively change and/or affect the life of a large community.</p>
